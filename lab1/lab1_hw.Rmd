## Instructions
Answer the following questions and complete the exercises in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run.  

Once your code is knitted, upload your document to Canvas. Homework is due before the start of the next lab. No late work is accepted. Make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!   

**1. Please complete the [class survey](https://forms.gle/AHHXd3aobaAdkkFg9).**

**2. Please join the [class discord](https://forms.gle/AHHXd3aobaAdkkFg9).**

**3. Navigate to my repository on GitHub. Notice that near the bottom there is a nice, clean description of the repository. You want this on your repository! It is built by making edits to the `README.md` file using RMarkdown. Edit your repository's `README.md` file so that you have a clean informative description, including your email address. Be creative! You don't need to just copy mine. There are lots of examples online.**  

**4. Make sure that you have completed `dummy_push.Rmd`. This includes successful upload to your repository and submission of the knitted document to Canvas.**
