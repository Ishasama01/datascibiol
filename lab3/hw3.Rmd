## Instructions
Answer the following questions and complete the exercises in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run.  

Once your code is knitted, upload your document to Canvas. Homework is due before the start of the next lab. No late work is accepted. Make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!  

## Load the tidyverse
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

## Data
For the homework, we will use data about vertebrate home range sizes. The data are in the class folder, but the reference is below.  

**Database of vertebrate home range sizes.**. 
Reference: Tamburello N, Cote IM, Dulvy NK (2015) Energy and the scaling of animal space use. The American Naturalist 186(2):196-211. http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/682070.  
Data: http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q5j65/1  

**1. Load the data into a new object called `homerange`.**

**2. Explore the data. What are the dimensions of the dataframe?**  

**3. Explore the data. Are there any NA's in the dataframe? Try using summary to determine which variables have more or less NA's.** 

**4. Explore the data. What are the dimensions of the dataframe?** 

**5. Explore the data. What are the names of the columns in the dataframe?**

**6. Based on the summary output, do you see anything in the data that looks strange? Think like a biologist and consider the variables in the data frame.**  

**7. Change the class of the variables `taxon` and `order` to factors and display their levels.**  

**8. Use `select` to pull out the variables taxon and common.name.**  

**9. Which taxa are most represented in the data? How about least represented?**  

**10. Use `filter` to pull out all mammals from the data.**
